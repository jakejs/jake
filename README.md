### Jake -- JavaScript build tool for Node.js

### Installing with [NPM](http://npmjs.org/)

    npm install -g jake

Note that Jake is a system-level tool, and wants to be installed globally.

### Installing from source

Prerequisites: Jake requires Node.js. (<http://nodejs.org/>)

Get Jake:

    git clone git://github.com/mde/jake.git

Build Jake:

    cd jake && make && sudo make install

By default Jake is installed in "/usr/local." To install it into a different
directory (e.g., one that doesn't require super-user privilege), pass the PREFIX
variable to the `make install` command.  For example, to install it into a
"jake" directory in your home directory, you could use this:

    make && make install PREFIX=~/jake

If do you install Jake somewhere special, you'll need to add the "bin" directory
in the install target to your PATH to get access to the `jake` executable.

### Windows, installing from source

For Windows users installing from source, there are some additional steps.

*Assumed: current directory is the same directory where node.exe is present.*

Get Jake:

    git clone git://github.com/mde/jake.git node_modules/jake

Copy jake.bat and jake to the same directory as node.exe

    copy node_modules/jake/jake.bat jake.bat
    copy node_modules/jake/jake jake

Add the directory of node.exe to the environment PATH variable.

### Basic usage

    jake [options ...] [env variables ...] target

### Description

    Jake is a simple JavaScript build program with capabilities similar to the
    regular make or rake command.

    Jake has the following features:
        * Jakefiles are in standard JavaScript syntax
        * Tasks with prerequisites
        * Namespaces for tasks
        * Async task execution

### Options

    -V/v
    --version                   Display the program version.

    -h
    --help                      Display help information.

    -f *FILE*
    --jakefile *FILE*           Use FILE as the Jakefile.

    -C *DIRECTORY*
    --directory *DIRECTORY*     Change to DIRECTORY before running tasks.

    -J *JAKELIBDIR*
    --jakelibdir *JAKELIBDIR*   Auto-import any .jake files in JAKELIBDIR.
                                (default is 'jakelib')

    -B
    --always-make               Unconditionally make all targets.

    -t
    --trace                     Enable full backtracke.

    -T
    --tasks                     Display the tasks, with descriptions, then exit.

### Jakefile syntax

A Jakefile is just executable JavaScript. You can include whatever JavaScript
you want in it.

## API Docs

API docs [can be found here](http://mde.github.com/jake/doc/).

## Tasks

Use `task` to define tasks. Call it with two arguments (and one optional
argument):

```javascript
task(name, [prerequisites], action, [opts]);
```

The `name` argument is a String with the name of the task, and `prerequisites`
is an optional Array arg of the list of prerequisite tasks to perform first.

The `action` is a Function defininng the action to take for the task. (Note that
Object-literal syntax for name/prerequisites in a single argument a la Rake is
also supported, but JavaScript's lack of support for dynamic keys in Object
literals makes it not very useful.) The action is invoked with the Task object
itself as the execution context (i.e, "this" inside the action references the
Task object).

The `opts` argument is optional. When a task's operations are asynchronous, the
`async` property should be set to `true` to notify Jake to wait for its
`complete` event before proceeding. The `async` flag is meant to describe the
operation, not the intended outcome. Asynchronous tasks should always call
`complete()` to signal they have completed. By default this property is `false`.
(Note: Passing a final Boolean literal to indicate `async` is deprecated, but
still supported.)

Tasks created with `task` are always executed when asked for (or are a
prerequisite). Tasks created with `file` are only executed if no file with the
given name exists or if any of its file-prerequisites are more recent than the
file named by the task. Also, if any prerequisite is a regular task, the file
task will always be executed.

Use `desc` to add a string description of the task.

Here's an example:

```javascript
desc('This is the default task.');
task('default', function (params) {
  console.log('This is the default task.');
});

desc('This task has prerequisites.');
task('hasPrereqs', ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'], function (params) {
  console.log('Ran some prereqs first.');
});
```

And here's an example of an asynchronous task:

```javascript
desc('This is an asynchronous task.');
task('asyncTask', function () {
  setTimeout(complete, 1000);
}, {async: true});
```

A Task is also an EventEmitter which emits the 'complete' event when it is
finished. This allows asynchronous tasks to be run from within other asked via
either `invoke` or `execute`, and ensure they will complete before the rest of
the containing task executes. See the section "Running tasks from within other
tasks," below.

### File-tasks

Create a file-task by calling `file`.

File-tasks create a file from one or more other files. With a file-task, Jake
checks both that the file exists, and also that it is not older than the files
specified by any prerequisite tasks. File-tasks are particularly useful for
compiling something from a tree of source files.

```javascript
desc('This builds a minified JS file for production.');
file('foo-minified.js', ['bar', 'foo-bar.js', 'foo-baz.js'], function () {
  // Code to concat and minify goes here
});
```

### Directory-tasks

Create a directory-task by calling `directory`.

Directory-tasks create a directory for use with for file-tasks. Jake checks for
the existence of the directory, and only creates it if needed.

```javascript
desc('This creates the bar directory for use with the foo-minified.js file-task.');
directory('bar');
```

This task will create the directory when used as a prerequisite for a file-task,
or when run from the command-line.

### Namespaces

Use `namespace` to create a namespace of tasks to perform. Call it with two arguments:

```javascript
namespace(name, namespaceTasks);
```

Where is `name` is the name of the namespace, and `namespaceTasks` is a function
with calls inside it to `task` or `desc` definining all the tasks for that
namespace.

Here's an example:

```javascript
desc('This is the default task.');
task('default', function () {
  console.log('This is the default task.');
});

namespace('foo', function () {
  desc('This the foo:bar task');
  task('bar', function () {
    console.log('doing foo:bar task');
  });

  desc('This the foo:baz task');
  task('baz', ['default', 'foo:bar'], function () {
    console.log('doing foo:baz task');
  });

});
```

In this example, the foo:baz task depends on the the default and foo:bar tasks.

### Passing parameters to jake

Parameters can be passed to Jake two ways: plain arguments, and environment
variables.

To pass positional arguments to the Jake tasks, enclose them in square braces,
separated by commas, after the name of the task on the command-line. For
example, with the following Jakefile:

```javascript
desc('This is an awesome task.');
task('awesome', function (a, b, c) {
  console.log(a, b, c);
});
```

You could run `jake` like this:

    jake awesome[foo,bar,baz]

And you'd get the following output:

    foo bar baz

Note that you *cannot* uses spaces between the commas separating the parameters.

Any parameters passed after the Jake task that contain an equals sign (=) will
be added to process.env.

With the following Jakefile:

```javascript
desc('This is an awesome task.');
task('awesome', function (a, b, c) {
  console.log(a, b, c);
  console.log(process.env.qux, process.env.frang);
});
```

You could run `jake` like this:

    jake awesome[foo,bar,baz] qux=zoobie frang=asdf

And you'd get the following output:

    foo bar baz
    zoobie asdf
Running `jake` with no arguments runs the default task.

__Note for zsh users__ : you will need to escape the brackets or wrap in single
quotes like this to pass parameters :

    jake 'awesome[foo,bar,baz]'

An other solution is to desactivate permannently file-globbing for the `jake`
command. You can do this by adding this line to your `.zshrc` file :

    alias jake="noglob jake"

### Running tasks from within other tasks

Jake supports the ability to run a task from within another task via the
`invoke` and `execute` methods.

The `invoke` method will run the desired task, along with its prerequisites:

```javascript
desc('Calls the foo:bar task and its prerequisites.');
task('invokeFooBar', function () {
  // Calls foo:bar and its prereqs
  jake.Task['foo:bar'].invoke();
});
```

Tasks are EventEmitters. If the inner-task invoked is asynchronous, you can set
a listener on the 'complete' event to run any code that depends on it.

```javascript
desc('Calls the async foo:baz task and its prerequisites.');
task('invokeFooBaz', function () {
  var t = jake.Task['foo:baz'];
  t.addListener('complete', function () {
    console.log('Finished executing foo:baz');
    // Maybe run some other code
    // ...
    // Complete the containing task
    complete();
  });
  // Kick off foo:baz
  t.invoke();
}, {async: true});
```

The `invoke` method will only run the task once, even if you call it repeatedly.

```javascript
desc('Calls the foo:bar task and its prerequisites.');
task('invokeFooBar', function () {
  // Calls foo:bar and its prereqs
  jake.Task['foo:bar'].invoke();
  // Does nothing
  jake.Task['foo:bar'].invoke();
});
```

The `execute` method will run the desired task without its prerequisites:

```javascript
desc('Calls the foo:bar task without its prerequisites.');
task('executeFooBar', function () {
  // Calls foo:bar without its prereqs
  jake.Task['foo:baz'].execute();
});
```

Calling `execute` repeatedly will run the desired task repeatedly.

```javascript
desc('Calls the foo:bar task without its prerequisites.');
task('executeFooBar', function () {
  // Calls foo:bar without its prereqs
  jake.Task['foo:baz'].execute();
  // Can keep running this over and over
  jake.Task['foo:baz'].execute();
  jake.Task['foo:baz'].execute();
});
```

If you want to run the task and its prerequisites more than once, you can use
`invoke` with the `reenable` method.

```javascript
desc('Calls the foo:bar task and its prerequisites.');
task('invokeFooBar', function () {
  // Calls foo:bar and its prereqs
  jake.Task['foo:bar'].invoke();
  // Does nothing
  jake.Task['foo:bar'].invoke();
  // Only re-runs foo:bar, but not its prerequisites
  jake.Task['foo:bar'].reenable();
  jake.Task['foo:bar'].invoke();
});
```

The `reenable` method takes a single Boolean arg, a 'deep' flag, which reenables
the task's prerequisites if set to true.

```javascript
desc('Calls the foo:bar task and its prerequisites.');
task('invokeFooBar', function () {
  // Calls foo:bar and its prereqs
  jake.Task['foo:bar'].invoke();
  // Does nothing
  jake.Task['foo:bar'].invoke();
  // Only re-runs foo:bar, but not its prerequisites
  jake.Task['foo:bar'].reenable(true);
  jake.Task['foo:bar'].invoke();
});
```

It's easy to pass params on to a sub-task run via `invoke` or `execute`:

```javascript
desc('Passes params on to other tasks.');
task('passParams', function () {
  var t = jake.Task['foo:bar'];
  // Calls foo:bar, passing along current args
  t.invoke.apply(t, arguments);
});
```

### Aborting a task

You can abort a task by calling the `fail` function, and Jake will abort the
currently running task. You can pass a customized error message to `fail`:

```javascript
desc('This task fails.');
task('failTask', function () {
  fail('Yikes. Something back happened.');
});
```

You can also pass an optional exit status-code to the fail command, like so:

```javascript
desc('This task fails with an exit-status of 42.');
task('failTaskQuestionCustomStatus', function () {
  fail('What is the answer?', 42);
});
```

The process will exit with a status of 42.

Uncaught errors will also abort the currently running task.

### Showing the list of tasks

Passing `jake` the -T or --tasks flag will display the full list of tasks
available in a Jakefile, along with their descriptions:

    $ jake -T
    jake default       # This is the default task.
    jake asdf          # This is the asdf task.
    jake concat.txt    # File task, concating two files together
    jake failure       # Failing task.
    jake lookup        # Jake task lookup by name.
    jake foo:bar       # This the foo:bar task
    jake foo:fonebone  # This the foo:fonebone task

Setting a value for -T/--tasks will filter the list by that value:

    $ jake -T foo
    jake foo:bar       # This the foo:bar task
    jake foo:fonebone  # This the foo:fonebone task

The list displayed will be all tasks whose namespace/name contain the filter-string.

### Breaking things up into multiple files

Jake will automatically look for files with a .jake extension in a 'jakelib'
directory in your project, and load them (via `require`) after loading your
Jakefile. (The directory name can be overridden using the -J/--jakelibdir
command-line option.)

This allows you to break your tasks up over multiple files -- a good way to do
it is one namespace per file: e.g., a `zardoz` namespace full of tasks in
'jakelib/zardox.jake'.

Note that these .jake files each run in their own module-context, so they don't
have access to each others' data. However, the Jake API methods, and the
task-hierarchy are globally available, so you can use tasks in any file as
prerequisites for tasks in any other, just as if everything were in a single
file.

Environment-variables set on the command-line are likewise also naturally
available to code in all files via process.env.

### File-utils

Since shelling out in Node is an asynchronous operation, Jake comes with a few
useful file-utilities with a synchronous API, that make scripting easier.

The `jake.mkdirP` utility recursively creates a set of nested directories. It
will not throw an error if any of the directories already exists. Here's an example:

```javascript
jake.mkdirP('app/views/layouts');
```

The `jake.cpR` utility does a recursive copy of a file or directory. It takes
two arguments, the file/directory to copy, and the destination. Note that this
command can only copy files and directories; it does not perform globbing (so
arguments like '*.txt' are not possible).

```javascript
jake.cpR(path.join(sourceDir, '/templates'), currentDir);
```

This would copy 'templates' (and all its contents) into `currentDir`.

The `jake.rmRf` utility recursively removes a directory and all its contents.

```javascript
jake.rmRf('pkg');
```

This would remove the 'pkg' directory, and all its contents.

### Running shell-commands with `jake.exec`

Jake also provides a more general utility function for running a sequence of
shell-commands. The `jake.exec` command takes an array of shell-command strings,
and a final callback to run after completing them. Here's an example from Jake's
Jakefile, that runs the tests:

```javascript
desc('Runs the Jake tests.');
task('test', function () {
  var cmds = [
    'node ./tests/parseargs.js'
  , 'node ./tests/task_base.js'
  , 'node ./tests/file_task.js'
  ];
  jake.exec(cmds, function () {
    console.log('All tests passed.');
    complete();
  }, {stdout: true});
}, {async: true});
```

It also takes an optional options-object, where you can set `stdout` (print to
stdout, default false), `stderr` (print to stderr, default false), and
`breakOnError` (stop execution on error, default true).

This command doesn't pipe input between commands -- it's for simple execution.
If you need something more sophisticated, Procstreams
(<https://github.com/polotek/procstreams>) might be a good option.

### PackageTask

Instantiating a PackageTask programmically creates a set of tasks for packaging
up your project for distribution. Here's an example:

```javascript
var t = new jake.PackageTask('fonebone', 'v0.1.2112', function () {
  var fileList = [
    'Jakefile'
  , 'README.md'
  , 'package.json'
  , 'lib/*'
  , 'bin/*'
  , 'tests/*'
  ];
  this.packageFiles.include(fileList);
  this.needTarGz = true;
  this.needTarBz2 = true;
});
```

This will automatically create a 'package' task that will assemble the specified
files in 'pkg/fonebone-v0.1.2112,' and compress them according to the specified
options. After running `jake package`, you'll have the following in pkg/:

    fonebone-v0.1.2112
    fonebone-v0.1.2112.tar.bz2
    fonebone-v0.1.2112.tar.gz

PackageTask also creates a 'clobber' task that removes the pkg/
directory.

The [PackageTask API
docs](http://mde.github.com/jake/doc/symbols/jake.PackageTask.html) include a
lot more information, including different archiving options.

PackageTask requires NodeJS's minimatch module
(https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch). It is used in FileList, which is used to
specify the list of files to include in your PackageTask (the packageFiles
property). (See FileList, below.)

### FileList

Jake's FileList takes a list of glob-patterns and file-names, and lazy-creates a
list of files to include. Instead of immediately searching the filesystem to
find the files, a FileList holds the pattern until it is actually used.

When any of the normal JavaScript Array methods (or the `toArray` method) are
called on the FileList, the pending patterns are resolved into an actual list of
file-names. FileList uses NodeJS's minimatchmodule
(https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch).

To build the list of files, use FileList's `include` and `exclude` methods:

```javascript
var list = new jake.FileList();
list.include('foo/*.txt');
list.include(['bar/*.txt', 'README.md']);
list.include('Makefile', 'package.json');
list.exclude('foo/zoobie.txt');
list.exclude(/foo\/src.*.txt/);
console.log(list.toArray());
```

The `include` method can be called either with an array of items, or multiple
single parameters. Items can be either glob-patterns, or individual file-names.

The `exclude` method will prevent files from being included in the list. These
files must resolve to actual files on the filesystem. It can be called either
with an array of items, or mutliple single parameters. Items can be
glob-patterns, individual file-names, string-representations of
regular-expressions, or regular-expression literals.

### NpmPublishTask

The NpmPublishTask builds on top of PackageTask to allow you to do a version
bump of your project, package it, and publish it to NPM. Define the task with
your project's name, and the list of files you want packaged and published to
NPM.

Here's an example from Jake's Jakefile:

```javascript
var p = new jake.NpmPublishTask('jake', [
  'Makefile'
, 'Jakefile'
, 'README.md'
, 'package.json'
, 'lib/*'
, 'bin/*'
, 'tests/*'
]);
```

The NpmPublishTask will automatically create a `publish` task which performs the
following steps:

1. Bump the version number in your package.json
2. Commit change in git, push it to GitHub
3. Create a git tag for the version
4. Push the tag to GitHub
5. Package the new version of your project
6. Publish it to NPM
7. Clean up the package

### CoffeeScript Jakefiles

Jake can also handle Jakefiles in CoffeeScript. Be sure to make it
Jakefile.coffee so Jake knows it's in CoffeeScript.

Here's an example:

```coffeescript
sys = require('sys')

desc 'This is the default task.'
task 'default', (params) ->
  console.log 'Ths is the default task.'
  console.log(sys.inspect(arguments))
  jake.Task['new'].invoke []

task 'new', ->
  console.log 'ello from new'
  jake.Task['foo:next'].invoke ['param']

namespace 'foo', ->
  task 'next', (param) ->
    console.log 'ello from next with param: ' + param
```
